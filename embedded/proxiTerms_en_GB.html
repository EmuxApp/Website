            <p>

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Emux’s obligations under these Terms of Service will be suspended and the time for performance of Emux’s obligations will be extended for the duration of the Events Outside of Emux’s Control; and</li>
                    <li>We will use Emux’s reasonable endeavours to find a solution by which Emux’s obligations under this Agreement may be performed despite the Events Outside of Emux’s Control.</li>
                </ol>

            <p><strong>11.4.</strong> Each of the conditions of these Terms of Service operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
